## 🛠 Project Purpose
The portal is designed for **SRM Institute of Science and Technology** to ensure a transparent, data-driven selection process for the graduating batch's highest honor. By using this system, the university can automatically rank students based on verified achievements while allowing faculty to perform manual audits through a premium administrative dashboard.
